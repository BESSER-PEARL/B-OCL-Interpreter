Welcome to BESSER's Object Constraint Language (BOCL) interpreter Documentation
=================================

**BOCL** is a tool designed to parse and evaluate the OCL constraints designed on **BESSER** models.
It is a python based implementation, that utilises parser and listener generated with the ANTLR4 grammer.

**BESSER** is a `low-modeling <https://modeling-languages.com/welcome-to-the-low-modeling-revolution/>`_
`low-code <https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-vs-model-driven/>`_ open-source platform built on top 
of our Python-based personal interpretation of a "Universal Modeling Language"

.. note::
   BESSER and BOCL are funded thanks to an `FNR Pearl grant <https://modeling-languages.com/a-smart-low-code-platform-for-smart-software-in-luxembourg-goodbye-barcelona/>`_
   led by the `Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology <https://www.list.lu/>`_ with the participation 
   of the `Snt/University of Luxembourg <https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/>`_ and open to all your contributions!
