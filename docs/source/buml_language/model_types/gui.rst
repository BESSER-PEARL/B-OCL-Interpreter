GUI model
=========

It presents GUI metamodel, an exclusive section dedicated to exploring the realm of graphical user interface (GUI) 
specification. Inspired by the widely recognized and adopted Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML), our framework 
guarantees compatibility and interoperability with existing UI modeling tools and frameworks. Leveraging the powerful 
capabilities of IFML, the GUI Metamodel empowers developers and designers to precisely articulate and define GUI components. 
Its abstract syntax facilitates seamless integration with diverse data sources and allows for effortless manipulation of 
elements from B-UML models.
