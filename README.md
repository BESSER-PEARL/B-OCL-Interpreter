# Template for BESSER-PEARL Organization Repositories

This Github template provides a collection of base files and configuration recommendations for kick-starting a new project in the BESSER-PEARL organization.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Using this template for your project

To use this template when creating a new repository in the BESSER-PEARL GitHub organization, you have to set the `Repository template` field to `BESSER-PEARL/template`.

The new repository will use this one as a template, meaning that it will contain all the files. 
Once the new repository is created, you can edit its files to adapt them to your needs.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Guidelines & Contributing

You will find a guided description of the steps you should follow in the [guidelines](guidelines.md) file.

## üìì Publishing the documentation to ReadTheDocs

This template also provides the base files to deploy the repository documentation using [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). In the `docs` folder you can find and edit all the Sphinx documentation sources. You can check the documentation generated from this template at the [following link](https://besser-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

For more information on how to connect your repository, customize, and deploy the documentation with ReadTheDocs, you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html). If you do not plan to use ReadTheDocs, remove the `docs` folder and the `.readthedocs.yaml` file from your repository.
